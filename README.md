# Hi there! 👋

I'm Etienne Terblanche, and I'm thrilled to welcome you to my GitHub profile! Here's a bit about me:

- 👀 I'm always interested in what everyone has recently learned. I believe there's something new to discover from each person's journey, and I'm eager to learn and grow alongside you.

- 🌱 Currently, my main areas of focus are Python and Microstrategy. I'm on a continuous learning journey to enhance my skills in these areas. In addition to that, I am fervently pursuing my career in sports.
  
- 💞️ I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to work on exciting projects and immerse myself in environments that promote learning and growth.

- 📫 Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub or drop me an email at [etienne@empowerbi.com](mailto:etienne@empowerbi.com). I'm always open to new connections, collaborations, and discussions.

Let's learn, grow, and create together! 🚀
